The modules reside in the package ``./app``.

Following are the notebooks that use function from ``./app/`` to perform
analysis.

1. ``Exploratory Analysis``

   -  Experiment flow across sessions and trials.

2. ``Behaviour Analysis``

   -  Response to stimulus.

3. ``Neurons Analysis``

   -  Neuron spikes and firing rate.

4. ``Phenomena Analysis``

   -  Neuron response with respect to different behaviours.

5. ``Machine Learning Modelling``

   -  Decoding neuron activity
   -  Effect of trial history on current response.
