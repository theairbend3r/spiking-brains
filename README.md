2. `Behaviour Analysis`
   - Response to stimulus.
3. `Neurons Analysis`
   - Neuron spikes and firing rate.
4. `Phenomena Analysis`
   - Neuron response with respect to different behaviours.
5. `Machine Learning Modelling`
   - Decoding neuron activity
   - Effect of trial history on current response.
