## Experiment and Analysis

### Goal

- Study the effect of memory on current response (to behavioral tasks) in mice using machine learning.

### Hypothesis

- Previous responses to visual stimulus, by the mouse, may affect its present response.

### Dataset

- A subset of the Steinmetz dataset (Steinmetz et al, 2019).
- It contains 39 sessions from 10 mice.
- The mice were shown 2 images and had to determine which image had the highest contrast.

### Method

- Train a logistic regression model to predict the mouse's response given the following input variables for `current timestamp - 1`.
  - Feedback type
  - Feedback time
  - Reward time
  - Response type
  - Contrast left
  - Contrast right
- Tune the model and use 8-fold cross validation gauge accuracy.
- Plot the confusion matrix to compare the actual mouse response vs the model's response.
- Analyse the beta-weights per input variable to see it's effect on the response.

### Results

- See `05_modelling.ipynb` notebook.
